# Email signatures are stupid
…but clients want me to create them for them sometimes. Yuck! This is a really simple php… app? that I made to generate a bunch of dumb email signatures from a CSV or JSON and then make it easy for ~~idiots~~ people to copy/paste into their Outlook or AOL or whatever dumb shit they use.
